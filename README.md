# Real-Time Stubble Burning Detection and Alert System

The project seeks to create an AI-based system that uses real-time satellite imagery data from four sources to identify instances of stubble burning. Using advanced image processing and geospatial analysis methodologies, the system detects fire outbreaks in farm fields and alerts authorities in real-time. This anticipatory measure prevents extensive burning, improving air quality and environmental health.
### *Key Features of the Real-Time Stubble Burning Detection System*  

1. *Multi-Satellite Data Integration*  
   - Utilizes real-time data from four different satellite sources to ensure accurate and continuous monitoring.  
   - Cross-references multiple data points to minimize false alarms and improve detection reliability.  

2. *AI-Powered Fire Detection*
- Employs machine learning and computer vision techniques to differentiate stubble burning from other fire events.  
   - Uses thermal imaging and spectral analysis to detect fire intensity, smoke patterns, and affected areas.  

3. *Automated Real-Time Alerts*  
   - Sends instant notifications to government authorities, environmental agencies, and local law enforcement.
- Alerts include precise geolocation, fire severity, and recommended actions for quick response.  

4. *Geospatial Analysis & Mapping*  
   - Integrates with GIS (Geographic Information System) to visualize fire outbreaks on interactive maps.  
   - Provides historical data to track burning trends and predict high-risk areas.  

5. *Scalability & Cost Efficiency*
- Uses freely available satellite data (e.g., NASA, ISRO, ESA) to ensure affordability and easy adoption.  
   - Can be expanded to monitor fires in multiple regions and integrated with additional environmental monitoring systems.  

6. *Impact on Air Quality & Climate*  
   - Helps reduce hazardous emissions like PM2.5, CO2, and other pollutants caused by stubble burning.
- Supports policymakers in enforcing regulations and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
